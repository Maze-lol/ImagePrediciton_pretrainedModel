Image prediction using a pretrained model vgg16

VGG16 is a convolution neural net (CNN ) architecture which was used to win ILSVR(Imagenet) competition in 2014. It is considered to be one of the excellent vision model architecture till date.

Used a pretrained model VGG16 so it is an easy image recognition
But if you want to use a different pretrained model like ResNet then steps are inside the notebook

I have used google collab so for image i have mounted my drive. So you have to modify the path as your need.
I have also provided a image of a dog to predict but if you want to use your image then feel free to use it and give it a try.
