Image prediction using a pretrained model vgg16

VGG16 is a convolution neural net (CNN ) architecture which was used to win ILSVR(Imagenet) competition in 2014. It is considered to be one of the excellent vision model architecture till date.

Used a pretrained model VGG16 so it is an easy image recognition
But if you want to use a different pretrained model like ResNet then steps are inside the notebook
